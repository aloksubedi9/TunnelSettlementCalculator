# Theoretical Background

## Vertical Settlement for TBM Tunnels

This tool calculates vertical settlement induced by TBM (Tunnel Boring Machine) tunneling, using a method proposed by Attewell et al. (1986) and Rankin (1988), similar to the approach by Oâ€™Reilly and New (1982). The settlement profile at the ground surface in the transverse direction is modeled as a Gaussian curve, specifically tailored for TBM tunneling applications.

### Settlement Equations

Settlement of a point at a distance \( y \) from the TBM tunnel axis is expressed as:

\[
S_v = S_{max} \exp\left(-\frac{y^2}{2i^2}\right)
\]

\[
\frac{V_s}{\sqrt{2\pi} \cdot i} = \exp\left(-\frac{y^2}{2i^2}\right)
\]

\[
\frac{V_L \cdot A}{\sqrt{2\pi} \cdot i} = \exp\left(-\frac{y^2}{2i^2}\right)
\]

Where:
- \( S_{max} \): Maximum settlement above the TBM tunnel axis.
- \( V_s \): Volume of the settlement trough per meter of tunnel advance, defined as a percentage \( V_L \) of the theoretical tunnel section \( A = \frac{D_{excav}^2}{4} \).
- \( i \): Trough width parameter, \( i = k \cdot z_0 \), where \( k \) is a dimensionless constant (dependent on soil type) and \( z_0 \) is the depth of the TBM tunnel axis below the surface.

For parallel twin TBM tunnels, the vertical displacement is calculated using superposition:

\[
S = S_{max} \left[ \exp\left(-\frac{y^2}{2i^2}\right) + \exp\left(-\frac{(y-L)^2}{2i^2}\right) \right]
\]

Where:
- \( L \): Distance between the axes of the two TBM tunnels.
- Volume loss parameters (\( V_L \), \( k \)) are determined based on geological and overburden conditions, as defined in the provided table.
